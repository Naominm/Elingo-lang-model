    Through the darkest of nights and the fiercest of fights,
    Comrades in arms, we scale towering heights.
    With unwavering loyalty, our spirits take flight,
    In the face of adversity, we shine ever bright.
    
    In the trenches of life, where challenges loom,
    Comrades in arms, we dispel the gloom.
    With laughter and tears, we chase away the gloom,
    In friendship's embrace, there's no fear of doom.
    
    Hand in hand, we face each new day,
    Comrades in arms, come what may.
    In the tapestry of life, we're woven to stay,
    Forever together, in our own special way.
    
    So here's to the comrades, the friendships we've found,
    In the battles we've faced, and on common ground.
    With bonds unbreakable, together we're bound,
    In the love and support that forever surrounds.
